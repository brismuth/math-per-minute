# Math per minute

Based on [preact-pwa](https://preact-pwa-yfxiijbzit.now.sh/). I wanted to get some exposure to progressive web apps, and after losing the math speed round in [Jackbox Party Pack 3's trivia game](https://jackboxgames.com/project/jbpp3/), I decided to build a math speed test of my own.
